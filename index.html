            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror video game developed by Capcom and released for the PlayStation in
            1999. It is the third installment in the Resident Evil series and takes place in two parts, before and after the events
            of Resident Evil 2. The story follows Jill Valentine and her efforts to escape from a city infected with a biological
            weapon. Choices through the game affect the story and ending. The game uses the same engine as its predecessors and
            features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles.
            
            Originally planned as a spin-off featuring a different protagonist, Resident Evil 3 was designed to have more
            action-oriented gameplay than previous Resident Evil games. It features a larger number of enemies and introduces the
            Nemesis creature, which periodically pursues the player. Accompanied by a major marketing campaign, Resident Evil 3
            received positive reviews and sold more than three million copies worldwide. Critics praised the game's detailed
            graphics and the Nemesis as an intimidating villain, but some criticized its short length and story. Resident Evil 3 was
            ported to Dreamcast, Windows and GameCube to varying success. A remake of the game was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox
            One, and Windows in 2020.</p>

       <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror game where the player controls the protagonist, Jill Valentine, from a
    third-person perspective to interact with the environment and enemies. The player takes control of another character for
    a brief portion of the game. To advance, the player explores a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating
    enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or
    climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and
    put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a
    certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special
    rooms to manage space.
    
    The player can use a variety of firearms to defeat enemies, ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher. Aside from
    enemies, parts of the environment, such as explosive barrels, can be shot at, causing them to explode and damage nearby
    enemies. The game also introduces the ability for players to dodge attacks or perform a quick 180-degree turn to evade
    enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Health is regained with
    first aid sprays, as well as herbs, which can be used separately or mixed together to increase their healing effect. The
    game also features an ammunition creation system that allows players to create new ammunition from different varieties
    of gunpowder. In addition to engaging in combat, the player must often solve puzzles that focus on logical and
    conceptual challenges.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service
        (S.T.A.R.S.) member Jill Valentine attempts to escape from Raccoon City. Most of the population has been transformed
        into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical
        company Umbrella. On her way to the Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who
        is killed by a new enemy. This creature, Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S.
        members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the
        Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor, and Nikolai Zinoviev.</p>

            <h3 class="display-6">Part 2</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As they make their way to the tower, Nikolai disappears and is presumed dead, while Nemesis corners the remaining
            members of the group on the cable car headed to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to
            crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the
            helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and
            infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus.
            Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's
            T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.</p>

        <div class="col-md">
            <h3 class="display-6">Part 3</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">After she regains consciousness, Jill proceeds towards the Raccoon Park and enters the park caretaker's cabin. There,
            she runs into Nikolai, who is alive. Nikolai is revealed to be one of the "supervisors" sent into Raccoon City to gather
            combat data of Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nikolai retreats, and Jill is confronted by a massive worm-like creature. Jill
            defeats the creature and escapes to an abandoned factory at the rear of the park. Inside the factory, Jill meets up with
            Carlos, who tells her that the U.S. government is planning to launch a thermobaric missile into Raccoon City to
            eradicate the T-Virus infestation. After confronting Nemesis and grabbing a keycard needed to escape, Jill learns from
            the factory's control tower that the missile attack on Raccoon City has begun, with only a short time left before the
            city is destroyed.

                <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">The Resident Evil franchise has had a variety of control schemes and gameplay mechanics throughout its history. The
                first game introduced tank controls to the series. In a game with tank controls, players control movement relative to
                the position of the player character. Pressing up (for example on a D-pad, analog stick, or cursor movement keys) on
                the game controller moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates
                them. This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction players push from the perspective
                of the camera. Some critics have posited that the control scheme is intentionally clumsy, meant to enhance stress
                and exacerbate difficulty.

        Resident Evil 4: <a href="#" class="alert-link">Play Now</a>
        <p class="mt-2" style="text-align: justify;">Resident Evil 2 received critical acclaim, with praise for its atmosphere, setting, graphics, audio, scenarios, and
        overall gameplay, as well as its improvements over the original game, but with some criticism towards its controls,
        voice acting and certain gameplay elements. It has appeared on a number of lists of the best video games ever made. It
        is the best-selling Resident Evil game for a single platform, shipping 5.77 million copies on PlayStation, combining its
        original release on PlayStation with the DualShock release. It was ported to Windows, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast and
        GameCube, and a modified 2.5D version was released for the Game.com handheld. The story of Resident Evil 2 was retold
        and built upon in several later games, and has been adapted into a variety of licensed works. It was followed by
        Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in 1999. A remake of the game was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in January
        2019.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="mt-2" style="text-align: justify;">On September 29, 1998, two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, most citizens of the Midwestern
        American mountain community Raccoon City have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon secretly
        developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Leon S. Kennedy, a police officer on his first day of duty,
        and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris, make their way to the Raccoon Police
        Department. They discover that most of the police force have been killed, and that Chris has left town to
        investigate Umbrella's headquarters in Europe. They split up to look for survivors and find a way out of the
        city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl, Sherry Birkin, who is on the run from an
        unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella
        researcher.

                A survival horror game, Resident Evil 2 features the same basic gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil.
                The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be
                equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the
                player can check the condition of the protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons.
